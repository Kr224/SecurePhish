# Phishing Detection Tool with Security Code Analyzer

## Description
This project is a comprehensive tool designed to detect phishing websites using machine learning and analyze code for common security vulnerabilities. It includes features for both phishing detection and basic security code quality checks, making it a versatile tool for security-focused applications.

## Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/phishing-detection-tool.git
   cd phishing-detection-tool
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
Run the tool from the command line:

```bash
python src/main.py
```

This will preprocess the dataset, extract features, train the phishing detection model, and perform security code analysis.

For integration testing and combining both phishing detection and code analysis:

```bash
python src/integration.py
```

## Features
1. **Phishing Detection**:
   - Utilizes machine learning to classify websites as phishing or legitimate based on various features.
   - Model trained on a dataset of phishing websites.

2. **Security Code Analysis**:
   - Scans HTML/JavaScript code for vulnerabilities such as inline JavaScript, the use of `eval`, and hard-coded credentials.
   - Provides a list of potential security issues detected in the code.

## Example
After running the integration script, you might see output like this:

```plaintext
Accuracy: 0.92

   macro avg       0.92      0.92      0.92      3317
weighted avg       0.92      0.92      0.92      3317

Security Issues Found: ['Inline JavaScript detected. Consider moving scripts to external files.']
